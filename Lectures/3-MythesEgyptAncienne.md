## context 
- 3000 years lead to beaucoup of variety in gods and stuff
- the history of ancient [[Egypte]] is divided into dynasties
	- époque thinite
	- ancien empire
		- unstable period 1
	- moyen empire
 		- unstable period 2
	- nouvel empire
 		- unstable period 3
	- basse époque
	- all this forms "égypte pharaonique" -> 30 dynasties
	- alexander the great
		- ptolémaïque
	- romaine

## sources for Egyptology
- primary sources: contemporary documents from 
- secondary sources: other people in history writing about Egypt
- For each subject, we'll start off with a primary source and then look at secondary sources about the topic
- luckily ancient Egypt has great documentation
- 
	- stèles: blocs gravées
	- statues
	- inscriptions et scènes
	- papyrus
	- ostracon (scherben von tongefässen)
- however almost all sources only tell about the elite and not about the general population, so keep that in mind

## 1 Les dieux en [[Egypte]] ancienne
- gods are put in the focus of myths in the context of a given ritual
- ancient egypt was much smaller than todays
- there is lower egypt (mostly nile delta) and high egypt :)
- gods are associated to a region, often a city
- ![[Pasted image 20240924154101.png]]
- if a city gets influential, so does its main god
- one god many names
	- Ra comes from Heliopolis (greek)
- gods always come in groups or families if you will
- if statue in temple, temple belongs to god of statue
- titles of gods:
	- give information about their role
	- goddess lionne sekhmet => la puissante (the strong)
	- Association of two different gods
		- just mix and match -> Re + Amon = Amon-Re
	- god =/= person
	- the name of a god is always followed by a title that specifies their purpose
- Sekhmet => has lion head => danger => brings evils
	- might bring maladies
	- but if appeased, can also be remove maladies
- Bastet => is a cat => good
	- protects people, is goddess of family, love, fertility etc.
- role ambivalente
- back to sun
	- orient -> occident
	- barques is primary mode of transportation
	- gods obviously also travel in barques
	- therefore also the sun
	- Occident => place where the dead go
		- morgues are west
	- in the night the sun travels through the underworld
	- death is just prep for new life
	- super detailed afterlife := Douat
	- tombs and funeral texts tell the story of the suns travel through the afterlife
	- in one variant the dead travel with ra on the sun
- Osiris => god of the dead
	- great god, is more important
	- originally from abydos
	- 
- Rê => god of the sun that travels on a barque
- Anubis => Brings people to osiris
	- the heart (often a vase) of the died is placed on a scale and weighed with a feather
	- the person displayed always passes this trial
	- people also need to know the names of all gods present with osiris
- Ammut => female, head of a crocodile, legs of a lion, behind of hippo
	- demon rather than deity
	- role was to eat dead that would fail scales
- Thot => god of hieroglyphs and judgement, notes down result of weighing
- Amon => Was from Thebes which was capital
	- therefore very important
	- god king
- Horus => 
- Osiris => 
- [[Isis]] => 
- Nephtys => 
## 2 La variété des sources les mythèmes
- "Myth" is not a term that was already used in ancient Egypt, it was only introduced in ancient greece
	- "Récit qui met en scènes les dieux avec une conclusion et qui explique un ou plusieurs aspects du monde, souvent vu comme fabuleux"
- In Egypt multiple explanations may contradict each other
- no linear telling of story for ancient Egypt, always lots and lots and lots of variety
- dont do historical imperialism
- Example: Myth of Osiris (allusions) / The battle between Horus and Seth
	- séance "la construction d'un panthéon"
	- séance "Mythe et politique: les origines de la société"
- Example: Récits de la naissance du monde (allusions) / Le Livre de la Vache du Ciel
	- séance "Cosmogonie et antrhopogonie: l'homme entre les dieux et les animaux"

## 3 Mythes et pratique rituelle
- Myths are integrated in what is to be done in situations
	- when a human that is sick we refer to the time some god was sick and was healed and follow what was done in the myth
	- one myth often alludes to multiple contexts and gods
- Example: La légende d'Isis et de Rê
	- One source on papyrus that is the main one
	- Lots of others that are on other media
	- Isis is a powerful mage that can help humans
	- ![[Pasted image 20240924163208.png]]
	- Is the mother of horus
	- Isis and ??? have the same appearance
	-
