- mesopotamia
	- atrahasis
	- enuma elish
	- [[Gilgamesh]]
- Levant
	- ougarit: le cycle de ba'al
- the most important part of a myth is its end (the message)
### L'√©pop√©e de [[Gilgamesh]]
- traditions reaching back to 3000 BEC
- Found among other sites in the library of [[Ashurbanipal]]
- translated in the seventh century
- There is still a part of the text missing, but what was found is already long and rich in content
- Gilgamesh: 
	- roi de Uruk
	- surhomme (1/3 human, 2/3 god)
	- Uruk is real Gilgamesh might just be a myth
	- 4√®me roi apres la d√©luge (after the flood)
	- Is a very good king but with some nasty habits
		- harasses the young men of uruk
		- newly wed women are forced to spend their wedding night with [[Gilgamesh]] first and with their husband second
	- The women ask the gods for help, and they decide to create a stronger version of [[Gilgamesh]] and let that be a counterbalance to the king
	- The goddess Aruru the creator of humanity creates Enkidu, who is a savage that lives with gazelles and is incredibly strong and stuff
		- Gets civilised by a prostitute called Shamhat with a haircut, sex and beer
	- Enkidu and [[Gilgamesh]] fight in the streets and become best friends
	- They want to leave for an adventure


#### Les combats
- Das la for√™t de c√®dres
- Humbaba fights gilgamesh and enkidu
- Humbaba is the giant (monster?) that guards the forest
- Shamash helps them kill the giant

- Once they returned the goddess Ishtar wants to marry [[Gilgamesh]] but is rejected, then understandably punishes uruk by sending the divine bull
- They defeat the bull in epic combat

- In a dream it is revealed to Enkidu that the gods decided to kill one of the two for killing both Humbaba and the divine bull and that it will be him.
- He curses everyone that brought him into civilisation and civilisation itself, but is then reminded by the sun god that civilisation did a lot of good for him
- Enkidu dies of some illness soon after -> no honor

#### Le d√©luge - the flood
- [[Gilgamesh]], heartbroken by the death of Enkidu, sets out to achieve immortality, in search of Uta-Napishti, the only person to ever have gained immortality
- Gilgamesh asks Uta-Napishti how to gain immortality
- Constructing an arch allowed utanapishti to survive
	- almost exactly noas arch
- this was translated by some christian in the 19th century and therefore led to some controversy in christian circles
- we now know that noa's arch is by no means an exception
- heroes tend to be inserted into any heroic story
- Uta-Napishti was a survivor of a previous purge (kill all humans) by some god and was turned immortal and elevated into godhood by the same in order to not have to deal with a surviving human
- is challenged to resist sleep for seven days and nights but fails 
- gets told about a plant that turns him young
- he finds it, but some serpent eats it -> explanation why serpents skin themselves
##### la vie √©ternelle
- he returns to uruk having made peace with his mortality but now trying to conserve his memory and the civilisation he built
- he builds a wall

##### Le No√© m√©sopotamien?
- Problematic cultural imperialism :)

### Conclusion
- Gilgamesh becomes a king worth immortalising by accepting his mortality
- if even [[Gilgamesh]] could not achieve immortality, no one can or should even try, but a focus on civilisation is what the text probably wants to invoke
